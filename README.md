# notefinder
A musical scale note finder.

A simple command line Python thing to find the notes in a musical scale.

I made this as a way to reinforced what I had learned at about working with dictionaries in Python.

What it do:

Pick either the major or minor scale and you will be show a list of notes. (Might add some more spicy ones later)

Choose a note and you will be shown all the notes in that scale.

That's It..

It works and does what it's meant to but theres probably a better way of doing it.

Any feedback on better coding practices and smarter ways of doing this would be greatly appreciated.
